# Weed Detection using YOLOv8

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the use of the **YOLOv8 object detection model** to identify and classify *weed* and *crop* instances from agricultural field images. The goal is to leverage deep learning for precision agriculture by automating weed detection, which can lead to more targeted herbicide use and improved crop yields.

## 🧠 Model & Framework

- **Model**: YOLOv8 (via SuperGradients)
- **Framework**: SuperGradients Training Library
- **Backend**: PyTorch
- **Data Format**: YOLO annotation style (bounding boxes + labels)

## 📁 Dataset

The notebook utilizes a weed detection dataset, which should be placed in the `dataset/` directory at the project root, with the following structure:

```
Weed Detection/
├── images/
│   ├── train/
│   ├── val/
│   └── test/
├── labels/
│   ├── train/
│   ├── val/
│   └── test/
```

Each image has a corresponding YOLO-formatted label file. The dataset consists of two classes:
- `crop`
- `weed`

## 🔧 Project Workflow

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Uses Kaggle environment with common libraries pre-installed
   - Installs `super-gradients` library for training

2. **Dataset Preparation**
   - Loads the YOLO-formatted dataset and organizes it into `train`, `val`, and `test` sets
   - Sets dataset paths and class names

3. **Model Definition**
   - Loads the `YOLOv8 and YOLO-NAS` model from SuperGradients
   - Applies YOLO-specific loss and evaluation metrics (e.g., mAP@0.5, mAP@0.5:0.95)

4. **Training Configuration**
   - Defines the following training parameters:
     - **Epochs**: 100
     - **Batch size**: 16
     - **Optimizer**: Adam with weight decay
     - **Learning rate**: 5e-4 with cosine decay
     - **Mixed precision training**: Enabled
     - **EMA (Exponential Moving Average)**: Enabled

   - Trains the model using SuperGradients' `Trainer` module

5. **Evaluation & Visualization**
   - Evaluates the best saved model on the test set
   - Visualizes ground truth and prediction overlaps

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

- **mAP@0.5**: Measures precision across object confidence thresholds
- **mAP@0.5:0.95**: A more rigorous evaluation averaging over multiple IoU thresholds

## 🖼️ Visualizations

The notebook includes visualization examples for:
- Ground truth bounding boxes
- Predicted detections after training
- Model performance comparison

## 🚀 How to Run
